# Friendship Book

This repository contains a digital version of a Belgian tradition 'friendship book' a book that would be shared by younglings and filled in by their friends as a memory, and to get to know their friends better.

## Tech Stack

As this project is based on a BeCode learning challenge. I will let myself inspire by the stack assigned.

- MongoDB : Database
- Angular : Frontend Javascript Framework
- Express : Backend NodeJS Framework
- NodeJS : Backend Javascript runtime environment

- TypeScript : As a learning challenge and a tool to write better code, I will abide by the use of TypeScript both in the front- and backend!

## Why a friendship-book ?

I sense that a ToDo list is a popular project to show on my developer' portfolio. Tough I feel like this project is more original and will challenge my knowledge a lot more since there are fewer examples of how to tackle this exercise on the web.

Meanwhile this project will cover the following:

- Building a web application in Angular
- Handle Forms in Angular
- Create a simple backend to support a Web Application
- Execute CRUD operations on a database
- Get out of my comfort zone and work with a new technology: MongoDB for the first time in a project based environment to showcase my adaptability.
